# Java Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:

String[] cars;
We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
To create an array of integers, you could write:

int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
Access the Elements of an Array
You can access an array element by referring to the index number.

This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
System.out.println(cars[0]);
// Outputs Volvo
